# Sorrells Insurance Solutions


This is a Insurance introductory website I created using React and css. I gave this website active social media marketing tools as well as links to social media to help out reach his brand. This was a great way to test my React knowledge!

## Description

The purpose of this project was to get more practice using React and css.
I also wanted to test my mobile responsive skills.
This was a great way to test Seo and real client projects.
I also found it useful to use the map funtion built in React throughout my code to make the UI much more efficiently.
I have also add a carousel function for the testimonials page
